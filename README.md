# SJCclubs
Just for practice I thought I could build the web app with all the clubs from Saint Joe listed   
I imagined this to be organized as Single Page Web Application (SPA).        
Also I am open for any suggestions.  
Sorry for grammar or spelling errors, English is my second language.
Trying to make git work.... again


To run the app:   
1. go to SJCclubs directory   
2. npm install   
3. node app.js    
4. in your browser go to localhost:4000
