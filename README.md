# SJCclubs
Just for practice I thought I could build the web app with all the clubs from Saint Joe listed   
I imagined this to be organized as Single Page Web Application (SPA)      

Sorry for grammar or spelling errors, English is my second language.


To run the app:   
1. go to SJCclubs directory   
2. npm install   
3. node app.js    
4. in your browser go to localhost:4000
